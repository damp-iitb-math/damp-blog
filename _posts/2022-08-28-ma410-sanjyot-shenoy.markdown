- Review by: Sanjyot Shenoy

- Instructor: Preeti Raman

- Pre-requisites: None. However, some familiarity with concepts taught in real analysis and linear algebra will be really helpful.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: It is a core course. 

- Course Content: Continuity and Differentiability in General Euclidean Spaces, Inverse Function Theorem, Implicit Function Theorem, Integration on Rectangles, Partitions of Unity, Integration on Chains, Tensor Products, Differentials, Poincaré Lemma, Stokes’ Law

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures were paced in a slightly slower pace, pre-mid-semester, with more focus on understanding fundamental concepts. Post mid-semester, the lectures were paced fairly well.

- Exams and Assignments: 2 Quizzes of 10% Weightage each, Mid-semester of 20% Weightage and End-semester of 40% weightage. Barring Quiz 2, all exams had objective based questions, with some challenging questions, but the exams were easy to score. The End-semester exam was made to be very scoring, in lieu of greater difficulty, with use of course notes allowed.

- Grading Policy: The Grading was fair, with slight leniency.

- Study Material and References: Calculus on Manifolds by Michael Spivak, Course notes given by Prof. herself, based on the same reference.

- Follow-up Courses: Differentiable Geometry (MA556), Courses involving Manifold Theory are encouraged following completion of this course, as the concepts learnt in this course form the foundation for manifold theory.

- Advice on Studying this course: The content at the start may seem easy, but the course will jump up in pace fairly quickly, so it is important to be attentive and regular in this course. If you were attentive in classes, asked questions, be regular, then you would find the class to be fairly easy to get a good grade in.
