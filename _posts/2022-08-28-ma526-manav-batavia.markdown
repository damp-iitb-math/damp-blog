- Review by: Manav Batavia

- Instructor: J.K. Verma

- Pre-requisites: MA419 and MA5101 are pre-requisites. Basic knowledge of groups, rings and modules is required.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: I enjoyed the core algebra courses (MA419 and MA414). I subsequently took the Algebra 2 course (MA5101), and MA526 seemed like the natural follow-up.

- Course Content: Chain conditions (Noetherian and Artinian rings and modules), primary decomposition, integral extensions, graded rings and modules, dimension theory.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures were very organised, had a strict structure and were decently paced.

- Exams and Assignments: There were 7 quizzes, of 15 marks each, of which the best 5 were considered for grading. The difficulty was on the harder side.

- Grading Policy: The grading was fair, but not lenient.

- Study Material and References: Extremely organised notes and assignments (with solutions) were provided by the instructor. The reference book was Introduction to Commutative Algebra by Atiyah and MacDonald.

- Follow-up Courses: Virtually all algebra courses in the department should be accessible to one who completes this course. Related topics such as algebraic geometry should also become easier to study on doing this course.
