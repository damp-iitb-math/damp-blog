- Instructor: Swapneel Mahajan

- Pre-requisites: No formal prerequisites, even a first year student is potentially eligible. However, a prior course done on group and ring theory might make the course a little easier and more interesting.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2019-20

- Motivation for taking the course: The course is very unique and involves the intermixing of several branches of mathematics like combinatorics, algebra and geometry. It gives one an idea of some practical applications of abstract algebraic objects. It also involves an abstract introduction to category theory and the theory of Lie algebra. It’s a good option for someone who is looking to study some modern mathematics without too many prerequisites.

- Course Content: Posets, monoids, split semisimple commutative algebras, hyperplane arrangements, Zeta and Mobius functions, category theory, Lie and Zie elements, Birkhoff algebra, Tits algebra, some more miscellaneous topics.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures are held from 9 pm to 10.30 pm on 3 nights a week for 1.5 hours each, but no lectures are held in the weeks before the mid-semester and end-semester exams. The lectures themselves are interesting and clear. The professor teaches at a reasonable pace and uses examples and models frequently.

- Exams and Assignments: There are no quizzes, mid-semester or end-semester exams. There was one assignment, which is moderately tough. There is also a course presentation, where the professor allots topics and ask the students to present the topics to the class after a preparation period of around 2-3 weeks.

- Grading Policy: The instructor guaranteed a BB if the 100% attendance criteria was met, and an AB if the 100% attendance criteria was met and the assignment and presentation were completed. It is also not hard to get an AA.

- Study Material and References: Detailed slides are provided, and are sufficient to study. One can also refer to relevant portions of the book “Bimonoids for hyperplane arrangements” by Marcelo Aguiar and Swapneel Mahajan.

- Follow-up Courses: None.
