- Review by: Sanjyot Shenoy
  
- Instructor: Rekha Kulkarni
  
- Pre-requisites: None

- Semester in which the course was taken: Autumn 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: It is a core course, and one of two most fundamental course of all the courses in the curriculum.

- Course Content: Real Number Line, Field Properties of Reals, LUB, GLB, Archimedean Property, Completeness Axiom of Reals, Topology on Real Line, Convergence/Divergence of Sequences, Real-valued Functions, Continuity, Uniform Continuity, Differentiability, Rolle’s Theorem, Mean Value Theorems, Limits of Functions, L’Hôpital’s rule, Taylor Series, Riemann Partitions, Integration, Substitution Rule, Change of Variables, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Uniform Convergence of Functions, Weierstrass-Stone Approximation Theorem, Fourier Series, Fejer’s Theorem

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lecture pacing was good, the quality of lectures was also good.

- Exams and Assignments: There were 2 Main Quizzes of 10% Weightage each. There was a mid-semester of 30% Weightage. The end-semester exam was of 50% weightage divided into two papers, one for pre-mid-semester syllabus, and the second for post-mid-semester syllabus. The exams were challenging.

- Grading Policy: The Grading was fairly strict, giving emphasis on precise arguments and logic

- Study Material and References: Principles of Mathematical Analysis by W. Rudin was the main reference. Apart from this, the Prof. had her own notes (in form of lecture slides)

- Follow-up Courses: MA 412, MA 408, MA 410, MA 406 are natural follow-ups.

- Advice on Studying this course: Regular Study is a must for this course. The course is content heavy, so it is important to solve the tutorials weekly and devote some amount of time every week to this course.
