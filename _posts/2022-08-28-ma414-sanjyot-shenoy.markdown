- Review by: Sanjyot Shenoy

- Instructor: Sudrashan Gurjar

- Pre-requisites: MA 419/Requisite knowledge of Groups and Rings and basics of Fields.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: It is a core course, but a rather important one, as it discusses theory on fields and Galois Theory.

- Course Content: Field Extensions, Finite Extensions, Algebraic Extensions, Normal Extensions, Simple Extensions, Primitive Element Theorem, Galois Extensions, Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, Field Characters, Hilbert Theorem 90, Computing Galois Groups of Quadratics, Cubics, Quartic Polynomials and other polynomials, Solvability by Radicals, Geometric Constructions using Straightedge and Compass.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lectures were of good quality and good pace. The content at the start may appear rather difficult due to lack of touch with basic algebra.

- Exams and Assignments: The course had a Mid-semester and End-semester. The exams were of moderate difficulty. The weightage was set to maximise good grades.

- Grading Policy: The Grading was fair, with slight leniency, as many people found the course slightly difficult, due to lack of experience with basic algebra.

- Study Material and References: Lecture Slides were based on Algebra by Serge Lang. Other references were Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote; Galois Theory by Emil Artin; Algebra by Michael Artin.

- Follow-up Courses: Algebra-II (MA5101) is the natural follow-up, Higher Level Algebra Courses can be taken post this.

- Advice on Studying this course: Regular Study is a must for this course. Also, you should revise MA 419 Content before you start learning this course. The course is content heavy, so it is important to solve the tutorials weekly and devote a good amount of time every week to this course.
