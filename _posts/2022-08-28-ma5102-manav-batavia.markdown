- Review by: Manav Batavia

- Instructor: Sandip Singh

- Pre-requisites: MA406 (General Topology), and some knowledge of group theory

- Semester in which the course was taken: Autumn 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: This course is an interesting example of how two seemingly disjoint branches in mathematics can be intricately related. From a technical standpoint, among other applications, algebraic topology provides a means of rigorously proving that certain spaces are not homeomorphic.

- Course Content: Homotopies, fundamental groups, covering spaces, deformation retracts, Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, equivalence of covering spaces, existence of covering spaces, deck transformations, singular homology, Hurewicz Theorem, long exact sequences, exact homology sequences, excision and Mayor-Vietoris Theorem.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Slow to moderate pace, very well explained for the most part. Lecture notes were mostly a rehash of the reference books. At times, sufficient motivation was not provided for certain topics.

- Exams and Assignments: Midsem (40), Endsem (40) and 1 presentation. Exams were moderately tough.

- Grading Policy: –

- Study Material and References: 
    1. Topology by J. Munkres 
    2. An Introduction to Algebraic Topology by Joseph J. Rotman

- Follow-up Courses: MA816 (Algebraic Topology), MA815 (Differential Topology). In addition, some algebraic courses will use the concepts introduced in this course.

- Advice on Studying this course: –
