- Review by: Manav Batavia

- Instructor: Ananthnarayan Hariharan

- Pre-requisites: Algebra-I(MA 414)

- Semester in which the course was taken: Autumn 2019-20

- Motivation for taking the course: This course is a continuation of Basic Algebra (MA419) and Algebra-I (MA 414), and is a prerequisite for most advanced algebra courses in the department.

- Course Content:Rings and ideals, prime and maximal ideals, Jacobson radical, Prime avoidance lemma, modules and submdules, homomorphisms and endomorphism rings, localization, free modules, direct sums, direct products and tensor products of modules, chain conditions, Noetherian and Artinian rings, primary decomposition. Additionally, student presentations covered the following topics: Zariski topology on Spec(R), discrete valuation rings, applications of Jordan-Holder theorem, polynomial ring in n variables over complex numbers, modules over a PID.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures were very well-paced. The instructor had a good idea of the extent of the students’ abilities and adjusted his pace to maintain interest as well as ensure understanding. As a result, lectures were very enjoyable, and by the end of the course, significant material was also covered. Students were required to pay attention and think in class, otherwise they would be called out by the instructor.

- Exams and Assignments: 4 quizzes, mid-semester, end-semester, presentation. Quizzes were open-notes. Difficulty level was easy to medium. 10 marks, 40 minutes duration each. Mid-semester was closed-door. Same difficulty as quizzes. 20 marks, 2 hours duration End-semester was open-notes. Difficulty was hard. 45 marks (scaled down to 30), 6 hours duration. Presentation was worth 10 marks. Each student could choose a topic on his/her own, or would be allotted one by the instructor depending on his/her interests. Each presentation was supposed to be 20-25 minutes long. Only best 3 out of (4 quizzes + presentation) were considered. Course total: 80 marks

- Grading Policy: Grading was fair.

- Study Material and References: Class notes, tutorial sheets

- Follow-up Courses: MA526 (Commutative algebra)

- Advice on Studying this course: –
