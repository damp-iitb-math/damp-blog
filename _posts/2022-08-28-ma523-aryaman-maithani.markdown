- Review by: Aryaman Maithani

- Instructor: Shripad M. Garge

- Pre-requisites: No formal prerequisites, Soft prerequisite – Basic Algebra (MA 419) but this can be taken in the semester you’re doing Basic Algebra alongside.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Autumn 2019-20

- Motivation for taking the course: –

- Course Content: Multiplicative functions, primitive roots modulo n, binary quadratic forms, quadratic reciprocity theorem, good approximations, continued fractions, four square theorem.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures were paced a bit on the slower side but the content being covered wasn’t too light at times, so the pace was adequate.

- Exams and Assignments: Two quizzes, one mid-semester and one end-semester; the first three were quite easy and the last was tougher comparatively.

- Grading Policy: It was absolute grading with thresholds for each grade.

- Study Material and References: We followed Baker’s books on number theory.

- Follow-up Courses: Analytic Number Theory (MA 532)

- Advice on Studying this course: –
