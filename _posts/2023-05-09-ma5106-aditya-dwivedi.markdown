- Instructor: Professor Gopala Krishna Srinivasan

- Pre-requisites: Real analysis, exposure to functional analysis

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2022-2023

- Motivation for taking the course: The contents of the course looks very exciting and I wanted to study Fourier series ever since physics courses talked about it.

- Course Content: Reimann lebesgue lemma, convergence theorems for Fourier series of a function, Jacobi theta identity, proof of riemann's functional equation, Schl√∂milch's formula for bessel functions, and the integral representation of bessel functions.legendre polynomials, bessel's inequality and the parseval formula, applications of Fourier series to PDEs ( isoperimetric problem etc) and Abel summability. Fejer's theorem, kronecker's theorem and weyl's equidistribution theorem, statement of borel's theorem on normal numbers.Fourier tranforms for rapidly decrasing functions and extension to integrable functions. Basic results regarding Fourier tranforms, and the Riemann lebesgue lemma, connections of hermits polynomials with shwarz class and the parseval formula. Sturm livoulle problems, Fourier analysis on Hilbert spaces and distributions.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lecture pacing was perfect and the lectures covered a good amount of content, the professor had shared his slides for the course earlier due to which it was easy to relook at what was done in class or catch if absent in class.

- Exams and Assignments: The exams were moderate to easy

- Grading Policy: Course had 2 quiz, 1 midsem and 1 endsem

- Study Material and References: The slides of the course and lectures are available on nptel and YouTube.Text references were given along for each subtopic, most recurring was mathematical physics by courrant and theory of sound, Fourier analysis by stien and shakarchi.

- Follow-up Courses: Modern theory of PDE, any analysis course

- Advice on Studying this course: One should study the material regularly as it is very fundamental course in analysis and covers very important content
