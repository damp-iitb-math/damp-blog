- Instructor: Surya Mallikarjuna

- Pre-requisites: None

- Semester in which the course was taken: Autumn 2021-22

- Motivation for taking the course: I had done Optimization before and had some interests in Game Theory due to SoS and it also was present in the DS minor basket

- Course Content: Combinatorial Games, Cooperative games, non-cooperative games, Nash equilibrium, stable and unstable equilibrium, basic decision analysis, game of nim, Gale Shapley Theorem

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures were good and self sufficient. Sir provided the notes (but this sem was hybrid so don’t know). Sometimes it gets too mathematical but that shouldn’t be a problem after your third semester. Basic concepts are taugh again like convergence etc. Notations can be a bit tricky and vague

- Exams and Assignments: There were 3 quizzes a midsem and an endsem. The weightages were 30,30 and 40 respectively

- Grading Policy: Grading was Normal, along the curve, if you studied hard you would get an AA or AB but scoring BB and BC required almost no effort

- Study Material and References: NPTEL course by the same professor

- Follow-up Courses: You can try CS6001 or any other advanced game theory course

- Advice on Studying this course: Be regular, not much math is required from your end as it’s linear programming and linear algebra. Basic concepts of diagonalising etc are required but understanding the interpretation of the math in the Game or the real world is tricky. Do the assignments (tuts) properly eventhough they aren’t graded
