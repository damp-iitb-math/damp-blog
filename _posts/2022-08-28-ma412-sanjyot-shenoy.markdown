- Review by: Sanjyot Shenoy

- Instructor: Bata K. Das

- Pre-requisites: MA 403/Requisite knowledge of Real Analysis.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: It is a core courses, but a fundamental course in analysis.

- Course Content: Complex Number Algebra, Complex Polynomials, Holomorphic Functions, Cauchy Riemann Equations, Complex Line Integral, Complex Derivative, Cauchy Integral Theorem and Formula, Morera’s Theorem, Cauchy Differential Formula, Analytic Functions, Power Series Representation of Holomorphic Functions, Liouville’s Theorem, Complex Trigonometric Functions, Complex Exponential and Complex Logarithm, Zeros of Holomorphic Functions, Types of Singularities, Meromorphic Functions, Laurent Series Expansion, Applications of Laurent Series.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lecture pacing was quite slow pre-mid-semester, but picked up pace after mid-semester. The quality was good.

- Exams and Assignments: Mid-semester of 30% Weightage, Viva of 10% Weightage, Class Participation of 10% Weightage, End-semester of 50% Weightage. The exams were fairly easy, End-semester exam was slightly on difficult side.

- Grading Policy: The grading was fairly strict for the end-semester. The mid-semester and viva was easy.

- Study Material and References: Function Theory of One Complex Variable by Greene and Krantz was followed closely. 

- Follow-up Courses: Measure Theory (MA408) is a natural follow up to this course.

- Advice on Studying this course: Following the reference for this course and solving the exercises would give you a good advantage in this course. Attending the classes and taking part in the discussion was also beneficial.
