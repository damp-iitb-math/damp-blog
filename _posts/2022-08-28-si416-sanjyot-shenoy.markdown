- Instructor: Sanjeev Sabnis

- Pre-requisites: None. However familiarity with Linear Algebra and Real Analysis will be really helpful as most of the course relies on these two fields.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: Optimization is a very important tool used in a lot of fields, and also is one of the building blocks leading up to Analytics. I had initially taken this course, thinking it was a core course, but it served as an Department Elective in the end.

- Course Content: Basics of Optimization, Types of Optimization, First and Second Order Necessary Conditions for Minimizers, Sufficient Conditions for Optimizers, Golden Section Algorithm, Fibonacci Method, Newtonâ€™s Method, Gradient Descent Algorithm, Linear Optimization Problems, Simplex Algorithm, Non-Linear Optimization, Lagrange Theorem, KKT Theorem, Convex Optimization

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lectures were of fair speed. The Prof. used his notes made with help of the reference. The lectures were of fair quality.

- Exams and Assignments: We had 8 Assignments in total, accounting for 20% Weightage, 2 Quizes of 20% Total Weightage, Mid-sem of 20% Weightage and End-sem of 40% Weightage. The exams were fairly easy to moderate, however the questions were time-taking, and the time allotted for exams was slightly lesser, which made the exams slightly on tougher side, but overall, of moderate difficulty.

- Grading Policy: The Grading was fairly strict, with emphasis on precise arguments and methods to be used. Assignments comprised of questions directly from the reference which was being used.

- Study Material and References: Introduction to Optimization by Edwin Chong.

- Follow-up Courses: Any course in Analytics/Machine Learning/AI can be a good follow-up

- Advice on Studying this course: This course is fairly easy. Studying from the reference regularly, and solving its exercises would guarantee good grades.
