- Instructor: Sudarshan Gurjar

- Pre-requisites: No formal prerequisites, however general background on algebra(MA 414). Some commutative algebra is helpful.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2017-18

- Motivation for taking the course: A first course in algebraic geometry, useful for almost everyone in pure mathematics.

- Course Content: Varieties: Affine and projective varieties, coordinate rings, morphisms and rational maps, local ring of a point, function fields, dimension of a variety.Curves: Singular points and tangent lines, multiplicities and local rings, intersection multiplicities, Bezout\`s theorem for plane curves, Max Noether\`s theorem and some of its applications, group law on a nonsingular cubic, rational parametrization, branches and valuations.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Great lectures, at the right pace.

- Exams and Assignments: A midterm and a final were the only two grading methods.

- Grading Policy: Grading was fair.

- Study Material and References:
    1. Fulton – Algebraic Curves 
    2. Hartshorne – Algebraic Geometry (chapter 1) 
    3. Shafarevich – Basic Algebraic Geometry

- Follow-up Courses: None.

- Advice on Studying this course: –
