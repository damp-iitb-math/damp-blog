- Instructor: Rekha Santhanam

- Pre-requisites: None

- Semester in which the course was taken: Autumn 2019-20

- Motivation for taking the course: Had taken this course as a minor course, but it is a core course for all mathematics students, and one of the two most fundamental courses of the curriculum.

- Course Content: Groups, Subgroups, Lagrange’s Theorem, Group Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms, Normal Subgroups, Quotient Groups, Permutation Groups, Isomorphism Theorems, Sylow Theorems, Rings, Ideals, Ring Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms, Integral Domains, Euclidean Domains, PIDs, UFDs, Fields, Prime and Maximal Ideals, Polynomial Rings, GCD, Euclidean Division Algorithm, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Gauss Lemma, Eisenstein’s Criterion, Other Irreducibility Criteria.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lecture pacing was moderate. The lectures were slightly content heavy but conducted well.

- Exams and Assignments: There were weekly in-class quizzes of 2 marks accounting to 35% weightage. There was a mid-semester of 25% Weightage, and end-semester of 40% Weightage. The mid-semester was on a tougher side, whereas the end-semester exam was doable.

- Grading Policy: The grading was fair or sometimes lenient. The instructor focused more on learning.

- Study Material and References: Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote, Contemporary Abstract Algebra by J. Gallian, Algebra by M. Artin.

- Follow-up Courses: Algebra I (MA 414) is the natural follow up, other courses can be Basic Algebraic Topology (MA5102), Algebraic Number Theory (MA 524) and others.

- Advice on Studying this course: Regular Study is a must for this course. The course is extremely content heavy, so it is important to solve the tutorials weekly and devote a good amount of time every week to this course.
