- Review by: Sanjyot Shenoy

- Instructor: Santanu Dey

- Pre-requisites: MA 403/Requisite knowledge of Real Analysis.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: It is a core courses, but a fundamental course in analysis.

- Course Content: Topolgies on Sets, Basis and Sub-basis of Topology, Order Topology, Subspace Topology, Box and Product Topology, Limit Points and Closed Sets, Metric Induced Topology, Metric Spaces, Hausdorff Spaces, Continuos Functions, Homeomorphisms, Connected and Path-connected Spaces, Compact Spaces, Urysohnâ€™s Lemma, Tietze Extension Theorem, Countability Axioms, Tychonoff Theorem.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lectures were of good pace, and were fairly good enough to follow.

- Exams and Assignments: Two Quizzes of 15% Weightage Each, One Mid-semester of 25% Weightage. Take-home End-semester assignment of 45% Weightage. The exams were easy to moderate.

- Grading Policy: The grading was fair, and the grades were allotted with leniency.

- Study Material and References: Topology by James Munkres was the main reference and an excellent resource and lecture notes made by the Prof. himself (based on the same reference) was enough.

- Follow-up Courses: Basic Algebraic Topology(MA5102) is a good follow-up for this course.

- Advice on Studying this course: This course is slightly less heavier than usual analysis courses. Regular study, following the reference well and solving tutorials would guarantee a good grade.
