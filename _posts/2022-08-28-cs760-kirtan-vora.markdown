- Review by: Kirtan Vora

- Instructor: Sundar Vishwanathan and Mrinal Kumar

- Pre-requisites: No formal prerequisites but student should be comfortable with Linear Algebra and Basic Algebra.

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2019-20

- Motivation for taking the course: To explore techniques in combinatorics.

- Course Content: Odd town-even town problems, Ray Chaudhuri-Wilson Theorem, Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, Omitted intersection, Joint problem in Discrete Geometry, Bounds for the finite field Kakeya problem.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures till mid-semester were taught by Sundar sir, his lectures were tutorial style, sir used to explain the problems and the theory applied in it, then there was healthy fun and interesting class room discussion in which sir and students participated to attack the problem, the main thing was discussion in which many new things and ideas were learnt. After mid-semester, Prof. Mrinal takeover, the pace of lectures were standard, the nature of problem were different now due to which class discussion wasn’t favourable. Only after 2-3 lectures after mid-semester lectures were shifted to online mode in which sir send notes and recordings.

- Exams and Assignments: Before mid-semester there were 1-2 graded homework (elementary), the questions in mid-semester were of same taste as in lectures.

- Grading Policy: Course was taught for first time and grading was done only till mid-semester exam. 1-2 graded homeworks, mid-semester exam.

- Study Material and References: https://www.cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/FS18/LAMC/index.html (many of the topics were same as in the course given but it’s not exclusive); Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics by László Babai and Péter Frankl.

- Follow-up Courses: CS 490 R&D Project Course
