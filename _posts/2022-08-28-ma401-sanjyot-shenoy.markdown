- Instructor: Murali K. Srinivasan

- Pre-requisites: None

- Semester in which the course was taken: Autumn 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: It is a core course, and an advanced version of MA106.

- Course Content: Expressing System of Linear Equations through Matrices, Elementary Row/Column Operations, Solving Linear Equations with RREF (Gauss Elimination), Vector Spaces, Subspaces and Direct Sum, Span, Linear Independence, Basis of Vector Spaces, Linear Transformation, Matrices and Linear Transformation, Rank-Nullity Theorem, Determinants, Cramerâ€™s rule, Diagonalization Problem, Eigenvectors and Eigenspaces, Jordan Canonical Form, Inner Product Spaces, Spectral Theorems

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: The lecture spacing was good, and the quality of lectures was really good. The course was conducted through CDEEP.

- Exams and Assignments: There were weekly assignments of one or two questions to be solved from tutorials. There were two Quizzes of 10% Weightage each. There was a mid-semester of 30% Weightage and End-semester was of 40% Weightage, and the rest of the weightage was for class participation. The exams were easy with exception of End-semester which was challenging.

- Grading Policy: The grading was lenient, more emphasis was given on learning the concepts well.

- Study Material and References: Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze was the main reference. The course was conducted through slides/notes given by Prof. himself.

- Follow-up Courses: Linear Algebra can be used in a lot of different fields, not just mathematics. Basic Algebra (MA 419) is a good mathematical follow up. Any course on optimization/analytics, machine learning can be taken up as well.

- Advice on Studying this course: This course is fairly moderate, thanks to MA 106. Being regular in this course, and solving enough problems would guarantee a good grade.
