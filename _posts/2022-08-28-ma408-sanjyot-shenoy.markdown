- Instructor: Niranjan Balachandran

- Pre-requisites: MA 403/Requisite knowledge of Real Analysis and Complex Analysis

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: It is a core courses, but a fundamental course in modern analysis, required for higher level analysis courses.

- Course Content: Measures, Sigma Algebras, Borel Sigma Algebras, Pre-measure, Outer Measure, Caratheorodory Extension Theorem, Borel Measures on Real Line, Lebesgue Measure, Integration for measures, Lebesgue Integration, Fubini-Tonelli Theorem, Differentiation, Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Theorem, Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem, Integration by Parts, “Change of Variables” Formula, Functions of Bounded Variation, L^p Spaces and Hahn-Banach Theorem.Meromorphic Functions, Laurent Series Expansion, Applications of Laurent Series.

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures were content heavy, and required attentiveness. The lectures were well conducted with good explanations and examples.

- Exams and Assignments: Mid-semester Examination was supposed to be a group assignment of 40% Weightage. End-semester examination was of 40% Weightage. The rest 20% Weightage was allotted to Performance in Viva. The End-semester exam was difficult.

- Grading Policy: The Grading was strict, with emphasis on accuracy and precision. The viva was of fairly easy-moderate difficulty.

- Study Material and References: Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Applications by G.B. Folland (However the book is quite compact and terse) was the main reference, but Prof followed his own notes for exams and viva.

- Follow-up Courses: Functional Analysis(MA 503) is the natural follow-up course to this.

- Advise on Studying this course: Regular Study is a must for this course. The course is extremely content heavy, so it is important to solve the tutorials weekly and devote a good amount of time every week to this course.
