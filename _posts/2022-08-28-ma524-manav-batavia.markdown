- Review by: Manav Batavia

- Instructor: U.K. Anandavardhan

- Pre-requisites: MA419, MA5101

- Semester in which the course was taken: Spring 2020-21

- Motivation for taking the course: Having developed an interest in algebra via the core courses and some electives, algebraic number theory seemed like an interesting related subject.

- Course Content: Hensel’s lemma, Krasner’s lemma, Dedekind domains, completions, factorization of fractional primes over Dedekind domains, the different and discriminant, parallelotopes

- Lecture Quality and Pacing: Lectures were interesting and delivered at a medium pace. The lectures hardly ever lasted the allotted time of 1.5 hours, and were often just an hour long.

- Exams and Assignments: Grading was based on 2 assignments, both of which were very easy.

- Grading Policy: –

- Study Material and References: The instructor used slides, which were based on the reference book for the course: Algebraic Number Theory by Serge Lang.

- Follow-up Courses: –
